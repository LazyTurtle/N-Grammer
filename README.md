N-Grammer

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of a simple cache based natural language model and testing its components with different parameters.

Although, ultimately, it was not used, its necessary to install [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (which is an open-source software library for Natural Language Processing) in order to use PosTree. But this class is not complete at the moment contains several undocumented bugs that makes it impossible to properly use.
